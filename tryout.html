    <h4>CHECK OUT OUR FACILITY REPORTING FOR 2025</h4>

        <h4>FACILITY OF VOLUNTEERS: Looking after the welfare of the community and its environment</h4>
        <h4>Victories and Failures</h4>
        <div class="Wins" id="Wins">Victories</div>
          <p>The facility has accomplished exceptionally well over the past years. Despite the struggles we faced,
            we had to show our resilience and kept our determination, whether motivated or not. I share to you a sample
            of these achievements: 
          </p>
            <ol>
            <li>Opening volunteering services.</li>
            This helped the community by raising willing teenagers who contributed to its welfare.
            <li>Employment of young teenagers</li> 
            Through the years, we organized the charity events and managed to employ willing teenagers who volunteered
            to be part of our social works in these events. It makes us proud in the benefits they made by contributing 
            in their financial needs. 
            </ol> 
        <div class="Losses" id="Losses">Failures</div>
           <p>As it was previously mentioned, the facility has acknowledged its fair share of struggles.
            These are some of the unfortunate events we had to endure till today:
           </p>   
           <ol>
           <li>The loss of two teenagers</li>
           We were reported sad news over the year as two families mentioned the tragic losses of the profound loved ones
           due to inevitable cancer. We had to acknowledge the passing of two former volunteers who devoted themselves in
           our charity work.
           </ol>
